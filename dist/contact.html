The current version is one that is still based on the programmers' personal experience. We would be happy to get your opinions on how to change given categories or expand them, as well as on how we can change our data monitoring and make better use of it. We will be glad for any and all comments and evaluations.  Thank you in advance.</p><p class="pb-0">Please direct all your questions and comments to the following email address: <a href="mailto:jiriskala25@gmail.com"> jiriskala25@gmail.com</a></p></section></div></body></html>
