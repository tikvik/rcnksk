    h3 Creating new archive folders

The Others folder is meant for activities like free time, procrastination or lazing around.
    ol
      li You will find the Documents, Music, Pictures and Videos folders in the File Explorer panel. You can open it by clicking on the icon of the same name in the Taskbar of the operating program at the bottom of the screen. In the menu that appears, mark the aforementioned folders and right-click each folder and click on Remove from Shortcuts.
      li Then on the operating system desktop create folders for Paid Work, Unpaid Work, Recreation and Others.
      li Select the newly-created folders by right-clicking and in the menu enter the command for Add to Shortcuts.
